<h1 property="name" id="wb-cont" dir="ltr">Contribute to the GC Design System (Draft)</h1>



<div><div class="mwsgeneric-base-html parbase section">

<p>The GC design system needs to be constantly improving. The goal of this framework is to foster continuous improvement of the guidance through experimentation. It creates a space for departments to experiment and innovate, and contribute their findings for teh benefit of the whole GC web community.</p>

<h2>On this page</h2>
	<ul>
  <li><a href="#backlog">Backlog and experiments in progress</a></li>
	<li><a href="#alpha">Alpha</a></li>
  <li><a href="#beta">Beta</a></li>
  <li><a href="#stable">Stable</a></li>
	</ul>


<h2 id="backlog">Identifying a needed improvement</h2>

<p>While designing content for Canadians or while testing your current design, you may determine that either:</p>
<ul>
<li>an existing component, pattern or template needs to be improved</li>
<li>a new component, pattern or template is needed to fill a gap in the design system</li>
</ul>

<h3>Consult the backlog the backlog and the experiments in progress</h3>	
<p>The first step is to find out if the improvement has already been identified. To d so, consult the backlog and the experiments in progress:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/design-system-systeme-conception/projects/3">Backlog</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/design-system-systeme-conception/projects/1">Experiments in progress</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>If your suggestion is not already identified</h3>

<p>If the pattern or template you identified for improvement is not in the backlog, you can submit a proposal by opening an <a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/design-system-systeme-conception/issues">issue in GitHub</a>.</p>
	
<p>**** Placeholder for GitHub template or form to submit issue **** </p>

<p>The proposal must include at least:</p>
<ul>
<li>a description of the issue or gap identified</li>
<li>a hypothesis on how to fix it</li>

</ul>

<p>Suggestions will be revieweon a case-by-case basis and update the backlog accordingly.</p>


<h2 id="design">Design: from prototype to stable</h2>	

<h3>Initial design and prototype</h3>	
<p>As soon as some form of prototype exists, it can be moved from the backlog to the "Experiments in progress" project board.</p>

<p>Before participating in a design round, verify if there's already an institution leading a design round.</p>

<h3>Alpha</h3>

<p>To go from early prototype to Alpha, the prototype needs to be accompanied with documentation that includes at the minimum:</p>
<ul>
<li>a hypothesis of how to solve the issue</li>
<li>establish a timeframe for completing the work</li>
<li>a design or a coded prototype</li>
</ul>

<p>You can start using this documentation template, even though you don't need to fill every section - placeholder for documentation template).</p> 

<p>The Alpha phase is used to test the hypothesis, conduct research, include accessibility considerations, and code a working example for testing. </p> 

	
<h3>Beta</h3>
<p>To go from Alpha to Beta, the following must be done:</p>

<ul>
<li>have a working coded example</li>
<li>provide any CSS/JS overrides needed to implement in the latest WET theme for Canada.ca</li>
<li>do due diligence on accessibility (**** placeholder: need more details on what that means *****)</li>
<li>have a working coded example</li>
<li>provide rationale for design choices</li>
<li>provide some points on "When to use"</li>
<li>provide bilingual documentation, using the documentation template</li>
</ul>

<p>Use the Beta phase to scale up the experiment and fix any issues you encounter.</p> 
<p>Beta updates are available through the main design system library, and departments can use the beta versions, as long as they consider it an experiment and are willing to report back on findings.</p> 
	
<p>When using a beta version of a component, pattern or template, departments need to provide a way for people to provide feedback. (***placeholder for content on how to do that ***)</p>

<h3>Stable</h3>
<p>To go from Beta to Stable, the following must be done:</p>

<ul>
<li>integrated to core frameword (WET)</li>
<li>completely valid code</li>
<li>no accessibility issues left unresolved</li>
<li>***something about how this should get rolled out?***</li>

</ul>	
	
	
<h2>Iterate: do other design rounds</h2>

<p>Once a new or updated pattern has moved to stable, it becomes the new baseline guidance.</p>

<p>If this round hasn’t solved all the problems identified, or if new issues arise, the pattern or template can be added back to the backlog and be the subject of another design round.</p>
