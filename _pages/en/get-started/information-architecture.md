<h2 id="nav">Theme and institutional navigation</h2>

<p>Canada.ca helps people navigate in 3 different ways:</p>

<ul>


  <li class="theme-navigation"><strong>Theme navigation:</strong> people who do not know which institution offers what they are looking for can find it through theme and topic pages</li>

  <li><strong>Institutional navigation:</strong> people can find what they are looking for directly through the institutional presence of each department</li>

  <li><strong>Search:</strong> supports findability for both theme and institutional navigation through the on and off-site search engine</li>

</ul>

<p>Most people looking for government services and information don't understand how government is organized. To address this, the theme-based navigation is the priority navigation path on Canada.ca.</p>
<p>See where your content fits under themes and their corresponding topics in the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/government/about/design-system/topic-tree-content-types.html#tree">Canada.ca Topic tree</a>.</p>

<p>People who may not understand the operations or organization of the Government of Canada (GC) may access content through theme navigation. Theme pages organize topics in a way that people understand so they can find content that supports their tasks quickly. Theme pages link to topic pages and/or destination content. Topic pages allow people to discover top-task content related to a specific GC-wide topic. They also link to destination content.

  People can also access content through institutional navigation. This navigation is intended for people who are accustomed to dealing with specific institutions. An Institutional/Organizational profile presents all timely and relevant content offered by an institution. It then leads people to either theme or topic pages, or directly into destination content. Destination content is about services or information, program and policy development, news, campaigns and promotions, or corporate information.</p>

  <h2 id="url">URL model</h2>

  <p>Each web page has a primary URL, displayed in the browser’s address bar. All other URLs referring to the web page resolve to the primary URL. This applies to URL aliases, vanity URLs, redirected URLs or any other non-primary URL.</p>
  <section>
    <h3>How to write URLs</h3>
    <p>This applies to all URLs, including vanity URLs and subdomains:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>use plain language keywords</li>
      <li>avoid superfluous words such as “to”, “the”,  “a”, “an”, “by”, “for” (for example, “/apply-student-loan” instead of  “/how-to-apply-for-a-canadian-student-loan”</li>
      <li>separate keywords and path segments by hyphens</li>
      <li>use lowercase</li>
      <li>it is strongly recommended that you use unilingual keywords, in the  language of the page</li>
      <li>use only US-ASCII (7-bit version of ASCII)  characters (for example, “meteo” instead of “météo”)</li>
      <li>avoid duplicate keywords and apostrophes</li>
      <li>avoid acronyms and abbreviations, unless they are better understood than the full version or perform better on search engines </li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Writing URLs for communications products</h3>
    <p>When writing URLs for communication products, you can use either the primary URL or a vanity URL.</p>
    <p>Vanity URLs must:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>be easy to type and to communicate</li>
      <li>only include 1 path segment (only a  single slash)</li>
      <li>hide the file extension for HTML-based pages (for example, “canada.ca/passport”, “canada.ca/weather”) </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If the URL will be spoken out loud (for example, in radio and television advertisements), you can also have another vanity URL without hyphens. This will make it easier to read out loud.<p>
    <p>Example – Television advertisement:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>vanity URL for print:  canada.ca/employment-insurance-maternity </li>
      <li>vanity URL for television or radio:  canada.ca/employmentinsurancematernity (spoken “canada dot c a slash employment  insurance maternity”) </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: your account manager can submit new vanity URLs and change requests to the Principal Publisher using the <a href="http://requestform.portal.gc.ca/tickets.html">Request form for Canada.ca</a>.</p>
    </section>
    <h3>Sub-domains</h3>
    <p>Only use subdomains for content or services hosted outside the Managed Web Service.</p>
    <p>When choosing a subdomain:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>use plain language keywords that make sense to the user</li>
      <li>a maximum of 2 keywords is recommended</li>
      <li>it is strongly recommended that you use unilingual keywords, in the  language of the page</li>
      <li>related sub-sites and digital services must  be grouped under the same sub-domain, where possible
        <p class="mrgn-tp-md"><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Application for Employment Insurance benefits online <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-right"></span><span class="wb-inv">arrow pointing right</span> <code>employment-insurance.canada.ca/benefits/apply</code></li>
          <li>Employment Insurance Internet reporting service <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-right"></span><span class="wb-inv">arrow pointing right</span> <code>employment-insurance.canada.ca/reporting</code></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: your account manager can submit new Canada.ca sub-domains and change requests to the Principal Publisher using the <a href="http://requestform.portal.gc.ca/tickets.html">Request form for Canada.ca</a>. Sub-domain requests are reviewed by the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat. </p>
