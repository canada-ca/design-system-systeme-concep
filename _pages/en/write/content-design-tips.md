<p>When you design content, focus on the task: what are people trying to accomplish? How can my choices help them complete that task?</p>

<p>When working on content, answers people are looking for need to be:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>easy to find:</strong> is the information scent easy to follow to get to the right page, does it show up properly in search results, is the information located where people expect it, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>easy to understand:</strong> is the answer written in plain language, using the actual terms people are using, applying writing for the web best practices, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>easy to use:</strong> is the answer presented using the right design pattern, would interactive questions work better, would a filterable table work, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Content design best practices can give you a head start, but to be sure it actually works, you need to test your assumptions.</p>
