	<dl>
		<dt>Testing</dt>
		<dd>The use of collapsible content to incite people to choose between options was tested successfully during 2 optimization projects done with content from the Canada Revenue Agency.</dd>
	</dl>

<h2 id="rationale">When to use</h2>
<p>Collapsible content can be used in 2 situations: 
<ul>
	<li>To present a choice when the answers are mutually exclusive, meaning they don’t overlap with one another</li>
	<li>To presenting secondary information.</li>
</ul>	</p>
<h3>Choice between mutually exclusive answers</h3>
<p>Use this component when people need to get different answers based on their situation, and these answers are mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>This reduces the risk of having people wrongly think they got the answer that applies to their situation.</p>
<h3>Presenting secondary information</h3>
<p>Use this component to prevent secondary content from getting in the way of the primary task.</p>
<p>This can be content that applies to most people, but that only a few people may need to use (like a privacy statement, or additional details not needed to accomplish the main task).</p>
<p>It can also be content that applies only to a minority of people (like when there is specific information for a specific audience).</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="cautions">What to avoid</h2>
<p>Don't use this component for content that is needed by the majority of people to accomplish the main task on the page, unless you are using it for mutually exclusive answers.</p>

<p>Don't use this component if: </p>
<ul>
  <li>you need people to answer several questions to get the answer that applies to them</li>
  <li>one of the mutually exclusive answers has multiple sub-tasks or more than one page of supporting content</li>
</ul>

<p>In these cases, use <a href="https://design.canada.ca/common-design-patterns/interactive-questions.html">interactive questions</a> instead.</p>

<h2 id="how">Implementation and example</h2>
